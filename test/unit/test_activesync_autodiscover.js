/**
 * Test our ActiveSync AutoDiscover logic, specifically the case where our
 * autoconfig probes think they have found an AutoDiscover endpoint but we have
 * not actually run AutoDiscover.  All of our other automated ActiveSync tests
 * use hardcoded server paths and so aren't getting us coverage.
 *
 * Note: Our v1 autoconfig process *would* run AutoDiscover, but we've changed
 * that.)
 *
 * In the future we might also add some other weird AutoDiscover scenarios in
 * here.
