  <!-- So, in order for mozbrowser/mozapp to work right, we need to be living
       in an HTML document.  This is clearly a XUL document, so that doesn't
       quite work.  It's also simplest (or even required?) that we have a XUL
       document as our top-level, so we just run with it.  Because type=chrome,
       the inner dude has all our chrome privileges, etc.
